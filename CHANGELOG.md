## [Unreleased]

## [v0.15.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Added support for configuring admission Pod Disruption Budget via Helm values (`admission.podDisruptionBudget`) [#1490](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1490) [dttung2905](https://github.com/dttung2905)
- Added an opt-in `hamicore` binder plugin (depends on `gpusharing`) to write the HAMI-core GPU memory limit (`CUDA_DEVICE_MEMORY_LIMIT`) for fractional GPU pods.
- Added `global.podSecurityContext`, `global.resourceReservation.namespaceLabels`, `nodescaleadjuster.labels`, `crdupgrader.resources`, `topologyMigration.resources`, and `postCleanup.resources` to the Helm. chart.

### Changed
- Updated Go toolchain and base build images to v1.26.3.

### Fixed

## [v0.15.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Added `enabled` Helm values for `binder`, `podgrouper`, `podgroupcontroller`, `queuecontroller`, `admission`, and `scheduler` to allow disabling individual components from values.yaml. Previously these were hardcoded to `true` in the kai-config template.
- Added `prometheus.enabled` and `prometheus.externalPrometheusUrl` Helm values to configure Prometheus from values.yaml [#907](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/issues/907)
- Added validation for `subgroup` name in podgroup [faizanexe](https://github.com/faizan-exe)
- Added memory profile and run duration to snapshot tool [#1411](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1411)
- Added support for configuring pod and container security contexts on resource reservation pods via CLI flags [AdheipSingh](https://github.com/AdheipSingh)
- Added `operator.logLevel` Helm value to configure the operator log level (maps to `--zap-log-level` when set) [#1446](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1446) [dttung2905](https://github.com/dttung2905)
- The scheduler now implements elastic PodGroups on both the subgroup level (`minSubGroup`) and pods (`minAvailable`). This allows for elasticity on all of the podgroup tree hierarchy. [#1416](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1416) - [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)
- Allow the configuration of plugins in the binder service. [#1480](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1480) - [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)
- Added support for configuring scheduler log level and custom scheduler args via Helm values (`scheduler.args`) [#1452](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1452) [dttung2905](https://github.com/dttung2905)
- Added `global.jsonLog` Helm value to enable JSON-formatted logging for use with log aggregation platforms
- Added `crdupgrader.image.registry` Helm value to override `global.registry` for the `crd-upgrader` pre-install/pre-upgrade hook image, allowing the hook image to be served from a separate mirror without redirecting all chart images. [#1404](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1404)
- Added support for externally-created PodGroups. Workloads can opt out of podgrouper mutation with `kai.scheduler/skip-podgrouper: "true"` on the pod or owner chain, join an existing PodGroup via `pod-group-name`, and now get a pod condition when they reference a non-existent subgroup. [#1420](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1420)
- Added `--stuck-in-releasing-threshold` scheduler flag (default `2m`) controlling how long a Running pod with a `deletionTimestamp` remains classified as `Releasing` before being reclassified as `StuckInReleasing` and excluded from pipelining. Configurable per shard via `SchedulingShard.spec.args.stuck-in-releasing-threshold`.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** JobSet PodGroups no longer auto-calculate `minAvailable` from `parallelism × replicas`. The default is now 1. Use the `kai.scheduler/batch-min-member` annotation to set a custom value.
- Bumped `k8s.io/*` module group from v0.34.x to v0.35.4, `k8s.io/kubernetes` to v1.35.4, and `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` to v0.23.3, enabling KEP-4671 Workload API types. [#1466](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1466)
- Rebuilt the `crd-upgrader` hook image on `alpine:3.20` instead of `ubi9/ubi-minimal`. Image size drops from ~165 MB to ~67 MB uncompressed (~60% reduction), shrinking cold-pull latency on ephemeral CI runners. The image is also reused by the `topology-migration` and `post-delete` hook jobs as a generic `kubectl + bash` toolbox, so bash is preserved on the runtime image. [#1404](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1404)

### Fixed
- Streaming snapshot JSON directly into the zip writer to avoid OOM on large clusters. The `/get-snapshot` endpoint previously buffered the entire JSON payload in memory (~3x the data size); it now streams per-element, reducing peak memory to ~1x. [#1564](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1564)
- Fixed `additionalImagePullSecrets` in Config CR rendering as `map[name:...]` instead of plain strings by extracting `.name` from `global.imagePullSecrets` objects. Also propagated `global.imagePullSecrets` to all Helm hook jobs (`crd-upgrader`, `topology-migration`, `post-delete-cleanup`)
- Added `global.nodeSelector`, `global.tolerations`, `global.affinity`, `global.securityContext` support to the post-delete job hook.
- Fixed Helm template writing `imagesPullSecret` (string) instead of `additionalImagePullSecrets` (array) in Config CR, causing image pull secrets to be silently ignored. Added backward-compatible deprecated `imagesPullSecret` field to CRD schema. [#942](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/942)
- Fixed `windowSize` field in `SchedulingShard` CR to support Prometheus duration format (e.g. `1w`, `7d`). Previously, using `windowSize: 1w` as shown in the documentation caused the kai-operator to crash-loop with `time: unknown unit "w" in duration "1w"`.
- Race condition where `SyncForGpuGroup` could prematurely delete reservation pods when the informer cache had not yet propagated GPU group labels on recently-bound fraction pods. The binder now checks for active BindRequests referencing the GPU group before deleting a reservation pod.
- Fixed non-preemptible multi-device GPU memory jobs being allowed to exceed their queue's deserved GPU quota. The per-node quota check now correctly accounts for all requested GPU devices. [#1369](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1369)
- Added `resourceclaims/binding` RBAC permission to the binder ClusterRole for compatibility with Kubernetes v1.36+, where the `DRAResourceClaimGranularStatusAuthorization` feature gate requires explicit permission on the `resourceclaims/binding` subresource to modify `status.allocation` and `status.reservedFor` on ResourceClaims. [#1372](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1372) [praveen0raj](https://github.com/praveen0raj)
- Allow users to override minMember for k8s batch Jobs and JobSets using the `kai.scheduler/batch-min-member` annotation [#1308](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1308) [itsomri](https://github.com/itsomri)
- Fixed a bug where nil minMember caused subgroups creation to fail in scheduler [#1407](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1407) [itsomri](https://github.com/itsomri)
- Improved performance by evaluating SetNode once per session instead of on each predicate evaluation  [#1421](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1421) [itsomri](https://github.com/itsomri)
- Added persistent volumes to cluster snapshot [#1424](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1424) [itsomri](https://github.com/itsomri)
- Improved scheduling performance for preempt/reclaim/consolidate actions on jobs with many tasks by replacing per-task linear probing with exponential+binary search in the job solver, reducing the number of scenario simulations from O(n) to O(log n) [#1435](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1435) [itsomri](https://github.com/itsomri)
- Avoid expensive solver-backed reclaim/preempt/consolidation work for jobs already blocked by victim-invariant pre-solver failures such as missing PVCs, missing required ConfigMaps, or requests larger than the maximum node size. [#1502](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1502)
- Fixed `skipTopOwnerGrouper` not propagating per-type defaults (priority class and preemptibility) for skipped owners (e.g. `DynamoGraphDeployment`), causing PodGroup spec to retain stale values after defaults ConfigMap updates.
- Fixed binder DRA detection on clusters where the upstream `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate does not reflect server-side DRA availability. The binder now probes the API server during init (matching the scheduler) so the DRA plugin is gated on the same authoritative decision. [#1481](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1481)
- Suppressed noisy `Reconciler error` logs and `PodGrouperWarning` events on transient PodGroup update conflicts. The podgrouper now treats `IsConflict` errors as expected and silently requeues the reconcile instead of surfacing the apiserver's "object has been modified" message.
- Fixed kai-operator not reconciling on Prometheus and ServiceMonitor changes. The Config controller now watches owned `Prometheus` and `ServiceMonitor` resources, so deletions and drift trigger reconciliation. CRD presence is checked at startup against the API server (the scheme-only check used previously could not detect missing CRDs), and the watch is registered only when the CRDs are installed. [#877](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/877)
- Added `before-hook-creation` to the `crd-upgrader` Helm hook delete policy so failed hook Jobs no longer block subsequent `helm upgrade --install` retries. Aligns with the policy already used by the chart's other hook resources. [#1404](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1404)
- Fixed kai-operator leader-election event emission by adding RBAC permission for core `events` (`create`, `patch`, `update`) so operators can publish leadership events instead of logging `events is forbidden`. [#1572](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1572) [dttung2905](https://github.com/dttung2905)
- The scheduler's per-shard Service is now populated by an operator-managed `EndpointSlice` pointing at the current leader-election Lease holder, which is connected to the service of the shard's scheduler. This allows the service to route all it's incoming request to the lease-holding pod of the scheduler deployment. [#1593](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1593) [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)
- Fixed `podgroupcontroller` logging spurious errors on every reconcile for completed/failed pods because it tried to fetch DRA `ResourceClaim` objects that the DRA driver had already deleted. Terminal pods now skip the ResourceClaim lookup entirely, mirroring the scheduler-side fix in [#1456](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1456). [#1529](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1529)
